Your goal is to create a prompt engineering tool that streamlines the design process by using a component-based system. In this system, each prompt component functions like a modular code block—allowing you to easily insert, rearrange, and combine them to build comprehensive prompts, similar to constructing code in Scratch.\n\nThis tool is going to be a web application. It will allow users to sign in with supabase, and build a component library which will be stored in supabase, allowing them to build prompts, then copy them for use in LLM's. You are hosting this site with GitHub pages.\n\nYou have already made significant progress on this project, which is built with Vite, React, TypeScript, and SCSS. As you continue to develop the tool, focus on enhancing flexibility and speed in prompt creation while leveraging the modular design to address your development needs.",
