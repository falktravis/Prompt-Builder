Follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Code:**\n   - Carefully review the entire code line by line to fully grasp its implementation details and intended functionality.\n   - Confirm that you understand the original developer’s intent before making any modifications.\n\n2. **Document Thoroughly:**\n   - Update existing comments and add concise, descriptive comments that explain the purpose and functionality of each section.\n   - Ensure that a new developer can easily follow the code's flow through clear documentation.\n\n3. **Remove Un-used Code:**\n   - Trace all sources of data, variables, and functions, remove any pieces of code which are not being used. Unless they are specifically commented out or for use in later features.\n\n4. **Modularize:**\n   - Break the code into well-defined functions or modules, ensuring each function has a single, clear responsibility.\n   - Incorporate error handling and logging within each function.\n   - Include assertions and logs to verify correct outputs and facilitate debugging.\n\n5. **Enhance Efficiency:**\n   - Identify and eliminate redundant computations or unused code to optimize performance.\n   - Streamline logic where possible while preserving the intended functionality.\n\n6. **Review & Organize:**\n   - Rearrange functions and code sections into a logical, sequential order.\n   - Ensure the file’s formatting and structure strictly adhere to the style guidelines of the programming language.\n\nTake your time to understand the code thoroughly before beginning the refactoring process.",
